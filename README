This directory contains two different build-light solutions.

1. A ruby script that parses Hudson/Jenkins json output and drives an arduino (arduino code not included)
2. A standalone arduino project that leverages a network card to poll Hudson/Jenkins directly

Standalone arduino
==================
All the code for #2 is in the src folder.


Ruby script
===========
I use this script at work to monitor our Hudson builds (a specific view/collection of builds).

It drives an Arduino board with tonnes of LED's in it (Red and Blue) - schematic to follow one day.

Usage: monitor_builds.rb <hudson host> <path to view>
Example: ./monitor-builds.rb hudson2 product/CI
